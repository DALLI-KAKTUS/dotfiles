# Nix based macOS configuration. 
## might need some additional work because of limitations of apple(I am missing linux)...
most of the time Catppuccin[https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin] Mocha colorscheme was used...
for teminal apps I used nix package manager but for GUI apps I prefered Homebrew.
